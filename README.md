# 🔐 Advanced Encryption Tool (AES-256)

## 📘 Project Overview
This project is developed as part of **CODTECH Internship – Task 4**.  
The goal is to build an **Advanced Encryption Tool** that can **encrypt** and **decrypt files** using strong cryptographic algorithms like **AES-256**.

This tool ensures data privacy and security through password-based encryption and provides a **user-friendly graphical interface** for easy operation.

---

## ⚙️ Features
- 🔒 **AES-256 encryption and decryption**
- 🧩 Works with **any file type** (text, image, PDF, etc.)
- 💻 **Tkinter GUI interface** for easy use
- 🧠 **Password-based key generation**
- 📁 Saves encrypted and decrypted files automatically

---

## 🧰 Tech Stack
- **Language:** Python  
- **Libraries:** `pycryptodome`, `tkinter`, `hashlib`, `base64`, `os`

---

## 🚀 Installation & Setup

### 1️⃣ Clone or Download the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/advanced-encryption-tool.git
cd advanced-encryption-tool
````

### 2️⃣ Install Dependencies

Create a virtual environment (optional) and install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## ▶️ Usage

### Run the Application

```bash
python advanced_encryption_tool.py
```

### Steps:

1. Click **“Encrypt File”** to select a file and set a password.
   → Output: `<filename>.enc`
2. Click **“Decrypt File”** to restore the file using the same password.
   → Output: `<filename>_decrypted`

---

## 🧩 Example

**Input File:** `secret.txt`
**Password:** `mypassword123`
**Output Files:**

* Encrypted: `secret.txt.enc`
* Decrypted: `secret.txt_decrypted`

## 🧑‍💻 Developer Notes

* Encryption key is derived from the password using SHA-256 hashing.
* The **AES-CBC** mode is used with a random IV for each encryption.
* Files can be of any size or format.
* Always remember your password — lost passwords cannot be recovered.

## 🏁 Deliverable

A **robust encryption application** with a **user-friendly interface** for encrypting and decrypting files using **AES-256**.
